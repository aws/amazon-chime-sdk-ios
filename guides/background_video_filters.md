# What is Background Blur and Background Replacement?
The background blur and replacement APIs allows builders to apply blur or replacement on frames received from a video source. The filter processors uses a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) machine learning model to segment the foreground of a frame and then apply on top of the blurred background or a replacement image using built in swift capabilities. Follow this guide for more information on how to use `BackgroundBlurVideoFrameProcessor` and `BackgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor`.

Background blur and replacement are integrated in the `AmazonChimeSDKDemo` app. To try it out, follow these steps:
1. Run the `AmazonChimeSDKDemo` on your device.
2. Join a meeting.
3. Enable video.
4. Click on the `video`tab.
5. Click on the icon with three dots under your local video tile.
6. Enable `none`, `blur` or `replacement` filter from the menu.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* Have `AmazonChimeSDKMachineLearning` framework imported. Follow `README` for more information on how to import these depedencies.
* Understanding of [custom_video](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-ios/blob/master/guides/custom_video.md) guide.
* Basic to intermediate understanding of iOS development.
* Xcode version 11.3 or later.
* iOS device target of 10.0 or later.

## Overview
`BackgroundBlurVideoFrameProcessor` and `BackgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor` uses [`VideoSource`](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-ios/Protocols/VideoSource.html) and [`VideoSink`](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-ios/Protocols/VideoSink.html) APIs to consume and modify frames which are then fanned out to downstream sinks. To use the processors, builders must wire up the processor to a video source external (e.g. `DefaultCameraCaptureSource`) using `VideoSource.addVideoSink(sink:)`. Then enable the local video with background blur or replacement processor as the source using `AudioVideoControllerFacade.startLocalVideo(source:)`.

`BackgroundBlurVideoFrameProcessor` and `BackgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor` will return the same unmodified frame if any issues occur. Please see logs for more information.

### Implementing background blur in your application.

`BackgroundBlurVideoFrameProcessor` constructor takes a `BackgroundBlurConfiguration`:

`BackgroundBlurConfiguration`
```
logger: Logger,
blurStrength: BackgroundBlurStrength
```

1. logger: Logger to log any warnings or errors.
2. blurStrength: specifies the blur intensity, the higher the more blurred the background will be. See `BackgroundBlurStrength` for more information. The processor will default to `BackgroundBlurStrength.low` if not provided by the builder. It can also be changed later using the `setBlurStrength(newBlurStrength: BackgroundBlurStrength)` API.

Here's an example:

```
let backgroundBlurConfigurations = BackgroundBlurConfiguration(logger: ConsoleLogger(name: "BackgroundBlurProcessor"),
                                                               blurStrength: BackgroundBlurStrength.low)
let backgroundBlurVideoFrameProcessor = BackgroundBlurVideoFrameProcessor(backgroundBlurConfiguration: backgroundBlurConfigurations)

let cameraCaptureSource = DefaultCameraCaptureSource(logger: ConsoleLogger(name: "DefaultCameraCaptureSource"))

// Add the background blur processor as sink to the video source (e.g. `DefaultCameraCaptureSource`)
cameraCaptureSource.addVideoSink(sink: backgroundBlurVideoFrameProcessor)

// Use background blur processor as source
audioVideo.startLocalVideo(backgroundBlurVideoFrameProcessor)
```

`BackgroundBlurVideoFrameProcessor` will receive the frames and apply the foreground on top of the blurred background image which is sent to the downstream sinks to render the modified frame.

## Implementing background replacement in your application.

`BackgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor` constructor takes a `BackgroundReplacementConfiguration`:

`BackgroundReplacementConfiguration`
```
logger: Logger,
backgroundReplacementImage: UIImage
```

1. logger: Logger to log any warnings or errors.
2. backgroundReplacementImage: The background replacement image that will be used by the processor to replace the background. Note: the background replacement image width and height should match the `VideoFrame` width and height.

Here's an example:

```
let backgroundReplacementConfigurations = BackgroundReplacementConfiguration(logger: ConsoleLogger(name: "BackgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor"),
                                                                             backgroundReplacement: backgroundReplacementImage)
let backgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor = BackgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor(backgroundReplacementConfiguration: backgroundReplacementConfigurations)

let cameraCaptureSource = DefaultCameraCaptureSource(logger: ConsoleLogger(name: "DefaultCameraCaptureSource"))

// Add the background replacement processor as sink to the video source (e.g. `DefaultCameraCaptureSource`)
cameraCaptureSource.addVideoSink(sink: backgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor)

// Use background replacement processor as source
audioVideo.startLocalVideo(backgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor)
```

`BackgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor` will receive the frames and apply the foreground on top of the replacement image which is sent to the downstream sinks to render the modified frame.

Note that if you do NOT have `AmazonChimeSDKMachineLearning` framework imported into your application, the processor will simply pass frames unmodified.
Error messages will be logged to the Console accordingly.
