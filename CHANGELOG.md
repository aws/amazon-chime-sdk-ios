## Unreleased
### Added
- **Breaking** Added `start(callKitEnabled:)` in `AudioVideoControllerFacade` to accept a Bool type `callKitEnabled` parameter, which is set to `false` by default in `DefaultAudioVideoFacade`. Pass in `true` if your VoIP call has CallKit integration so that audio session interruptions are properly handled by the SDK.

### Changed
- `start()` in `DefaultAudioVideoFacade` now assumes the VoIP call to start has no CallKit integration by default to properly handle audio session interruptions. Use `start(callKitEnabled:)` to override the default behavior for calls that have CallKit integration.
- Initializers of all the public SDK classes are now publicly accessible to builders.

### Changed
- Updated demo app to work with updated [amazon-chime-sdk-js serverless demo](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-js/tree/master/demos/serverless). Note that you will need to redeploy the serverless demo to work with the updated demo app
- Updated methods for `AudioVideoObserver`, `RealtimeObserver`, `DeviceChangeObserver`, `VideoTileObserver`, and `MetricsObserver` to be called on main thread. Make sure to dispatch long-running tasks to another thread to avoid blocking the main thread.
